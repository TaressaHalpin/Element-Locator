PROBLEM: 
LARGEST ELEMENT LOCATOR 

Write the following method that returns the location of the largest element in a two-dimensional array.

```
public static int[] locateLargest(double[][] a)
```

The return value is a one-dimensional array that contains two elements. 
These two elements indicate
the row and column indices of the largest element in the two-dimensional array. 

Write a test program that prompts the user to enter a two-dimensional array
and displays the location of the largest element in the array.

SAMPLE RUN: 

```
Enter the number of rows and columns of the array: 3 4
Enter the array:
23.5 35 2 10
4.5 3 45 3.5
35 44 5.5 9.6
The location of the largest element is at (1, 2)
```
